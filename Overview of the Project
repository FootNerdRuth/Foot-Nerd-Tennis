We create a Healthkit for Tennis Players that follows the model of our current healthkit
We create conversations around the Why, How, What in podcast format while we're creating the actual digital product
We launch the digital product on April 1, 2023 - either on Mighty or Kajabi (the new platform we may be switching to)
We plan for the future product that follows the model of Foot Nerd Training - for Tennis Players
