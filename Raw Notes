Big high level "whys"

Move the needle in the public health crisis that is the western world (sick, diabetic, in pain, under muscled, overfat, etc). 

Find stats on metabolic heakth - it's a mess!

Tennis can be a huge lever that gets people moving, is fun, and can be played well into the later years of life. 

FNT will give people the ability to play tennis longer, more frequently, and with less pain.

A big problem is that most tennis players experience pain during or after playing. 
This stops them from playing as much as they would like. So they move less. Less movement = worse health.

FNT outcomes:
Less pain, better performance, more fun.

What is better performance? more power, quicker to the ball, more stamina, less fatigue. 

Pain points
Tennis elbow. Golfers elbow (I had golfers elbow (medial epycon.) eventhough i don't play golf)
Foot pain. Achilles tendonitis. Planter fascitis. Jacked up toes.



FNT will approach training from a different perspective than what is currently out there. It's not about doing "this exercise" or following a specific program. The goal is to give someone the tools to understand their body. Start with the health kit. 

The health kit gives someone the upgraded mental dashboard / operating system so that they can restore their own health.

They can play tennis pain free. And have more fun doing it.

Foot health / Sneakers 

Main point --> Prioritize foot health over sneakers. Smart sneakers - one that understands function of foot and ankle and maximizes the ability for the foot to produce force - to act like a magical spring! To load the right muscles so that connective tissue doesn't have to do all the work.

Once you understand foot health, you realize the exact shoe you choose isn't that important. Even if you play 5 days a week, that's still less than 5% of the usable active hours in the day. What you do with other 95% of your time will be way more impactful than the shoe you wear.

If you understand how the feet are designed to work, you constantly act to restore health to your feet by training weak points, you will be OK in most tennis sneakers.
