Nick Holt 11.25.22 Raw Notes 

High level points to address:

-- Shoes matter, but the overall health of your feet matter more. And the hips for that matter as well.
If you have a healthy foot and hips, you can probably wear any shoe and be OK.
So it begs the question --- what is current status of your feet? Health kit screens? Other quick objective measurements?

-- SAID principle in aciton. Understand what the shoe is doing to your feet and work to offset those damages. Just like we talk about sitting
and what it does to our hips. We need to extend hip joint to offset hip flexed. Same with feet and shoes. Most tennis shoes will be narrow and stiff
so we need to offset that wuth toe spreaders, toe mobility, plantar resets, human toe spreader, and time barefoot.

-- The role of surface on the body. Not too many sports are played on concrete. We need cushion to protect, but how much?! 
This is the million dollar question -- obviously more than standard minimal shoe but do we need all that cushioning we see on Rafa's Nike's or 
other tennis shoes? Goldie locks principle here - we want enough cushion to protect but not too much to turn off signals from foot or eliminate
strong, stable foundation we get from "feeling" more of the ground. This is a tricky one..

-- Sneaker breakdown. Go through a few examples. How do we modify FFTW for tennis? 
Flat yes. 
Flexible, sorta. But again, here we need to address the sweet spot of having some protection for lateral stop and starts. 
Thin, sorta but goldie locks - see above. 
Wide, yes.

-- Common tennis pain areas as it relates to sneakers. Basic anatomy if needed?
achilles pain.
Calf strains.
Knee pain.
Foot pain.
Toe pain.
Blisters.

-- Barefoot tennis? I saw a video on this and thought it was interesting.

-- What else??
