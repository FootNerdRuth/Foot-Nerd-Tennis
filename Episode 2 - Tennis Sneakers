Nick Holt 11.25.22 Raw Notes 

High level points to address:

-- Shoes matter, but the overall health of your feet matter more. And the hips for that matter as well.
If you have a healthy foot and hips, you can probably wear any shoe and be OK.
So it begs the question --- what is current status of your feet? Health kit screens? Other quick objective measurements?

Ruth: 
Quick Screens: 
Explain how the hips and feet are related to ankle, knees and low back - 
(many times people don't present with foot pain, but they do have back, ankle and knee issues and may not realize it's a feet and hip issue)
- a barefoot squat - the master screen - explain why it's the master screen
- a visual of the barefoot - shape, mobility at the toes etc.
- hand shakes & squeezing  - and then visually seeing the difference from foot to foot afterwards
questions to ask:
is the foot shaped like your shoe or natural shape like a baby foot - wider at the forefoot than the heel?

-- SAID principle in action. Understand what the shoe is doing to your feet and work to offset those damages. Just like we talk about sitting
and what it does to our hips. We need to extend hip joint to offset hip flexed. Same with feet and shoes. Most tennis shoes will be narrow and stiff
so we need to offset that with toe spreaders, toe mobility, plantar resets, human toe spreader, and time barefoot.

-- The role of surface on the body. Not too many sports are played on concrete. We need cushion to protect, but how much?! 
This is the million dollar question -- obviously more than standard minimal shoe but do we need all that cushioning we see on Rafa's Nike's or 
other tennis shoes? Goldie locks principle here - we want enough cushion to protect but not too much to turn off signals from foot or eliminate
strong, stable foundation we get from "feeling" more of the ground. This is a tricky one..

Ruth: 
Explain the engineering principle of the bridge: how the bridge, like the arch of the foot is designed for weight from the top
- stability and strength require that the weight come from above not supported from below
- an open loop system 
- explain basics of the foot anatomy (as if to a 10 year old)

-- Sneaker breakdown. Go through a few examples. How do we modify FFTW for tennis? 
Flat yes. 
Flexible, sorta. But again, here we need to address the sweet spot of having some protection for lateral stop and starts. 
Thin, sorta but goldie locks - see above. 
Wide, yes.

Ruth: 
Focus on unique individual needs, explorations
Talk about our personal experience
Show and tell with our actual shoes?

-- Common tennis pain areas as it relates to sneakers. Basic anatomy if needed?
achilles pain.
Calf strains.
Knee pain.
Foot pain.
Toe pain.
Blisters.

Ruth: 
Heel pain?
ball of foot?
IT band tightness?

-- Barefoot tennis? I saw a video on this and thought it was interesting.

Ruth: I watched this one. Is this the one you're talking about? So interesting.https://youtu.be/zbnMk5YGZsA
-- What else??

Ruth Raw Notes [12/1/22]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aNeGC6IU0Y  - Nick & Mike's shoptalk on athletic footwear - a great listen
- it doesn't have to be all or nothing but training in natural footwear breeds more information, learning and better overall footwork
- then a shoe that meets some of the criteria of the 4 F's will naturally follow, in my experience
- Rajeev Ram does some barefoot training in the gym - with @sonnymoonfitness (she's a foot nerd and I'm getting in touch with her)
Ruth Raw Notes [12/5/22]

Introduction Notes:
- wearing footwear is an unnatural habit that can reduce fnx of the entire body
- that said, we've compensated nicely able to do amazing things as shoe clad peeps
- we can use our bodies very well until we begin to hurt
- damage to feet accumulates over time so we don't always see the connection between what we've done and how we feel
- Katy Bowman "If you're a proactive health enthusiast, you should learn all about your shoes in order to prevent ailments from arising"
- whether you are motivated by prevention, pain relief or both, you should know how to evaluate your footwear

Anatomy of a shoe 
- each part of a shoe has a unique way of changing the mechanics of the foot
- especially when it comes to athletics 
- footwear design is complex
- in order to start increasing your foot health right away, the shoe anatomy is broken down into 4 main parts
--Parts of a shoe

1. The Sole
- it is what for what footwear was originally designed
- to protect the bottom of the feet - the skin from abrasions and punctures
- was originally a piece of hide strapped on
- modern footwear ranges in squishiness and thickness, stiffness, contour and height, slopes and lengths and widths
**each characteristic of the sole affects how our feet fxn relative to the ground
**each characteristic impacts which muscles get used in the gait cycle

2. The Upper
- top most material that connects the foot to the sole
- range from full coverage to forefoot only (think of a sneaker and a flip flop)
- qualities: How much of the foot is covered and what is the material made of

3. The Toe Box
- ways to measure 
- width 
- height
- toe spring - shoe manufacturers started tipping the toe box up - the big toe doesn't do it's extending job


4. The Heel
- maybe most important feature
- because this part of the shoe has the ability to radically change the geometry of the human body
- heel of the shoe aligns itself with the heel of the body
- a tiny wedge under our foundation causes compensatory actions in the ankle, knee, hip and spine and knocks our 
natural gait pattern off kilter
- in an instant
- people think they don't wear heels because they don't wear stilettos (running shoes, cowboy boots, men's dress shoes)
- a heel is considered "positive" when it is at any height above the rest of the foot
- from a health perspective, any shoe with a positive heel is going to affect the geometry of the body
- replacing "high heel" with "positive heel" will help you figure out which of your shoes are affecting how you move


The 4 F's of Natural Footwear
- feel the ground (thin)
- flat (no ramp/heel/zero drop)
- flexible (bendy)
- foot shaped (wider at the forefoot than the heel)
