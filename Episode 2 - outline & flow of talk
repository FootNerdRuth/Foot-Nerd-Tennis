Episode 2

1. Intro Ruth or Nick?
Hello 
Welcome
Thank you for listening, taking the time
Nick & I are Foot Nerds. 
We take excellent care of our health and we begin at the foundation: Our Feet
We take care of our health so we can play tennis for a lot longer and feeling great before, during and afterwards.


We're working on a digital protocol for tennis and racquet sports players because we see our tennis communities dealing 
with chronic pain and injuries and we want to help people feel better and play longer.

The bedrock of our project is in restoring healthy feet, since the feet are our foundation and 
affect the entire chain going upwards. We don't often spend enough time taking the best care of our 
feet and the entire body, ankles, knees, hips and backs -  suffers for the lack of awareness and reliable information. 

We're also going to address the upper body as well and deeper into other areas of the 
but today this episode is going to address the charged topic of footwear.

So let's dig in:

2. Why are talking about footwear today?
-- Shoes matter, but the overall health of your feet matter more. And the hips for that matter as well.
If you have a healthy foot and hips, you can probably wear any shoe and be OK.
So it begs the question --- what is current status of your feet? Health kit screens? Other quick objective measurements?

Tell them to pause the video or we can do this with them: 
- take off shoes and socks and get a visual of the barefoot - shape, mobility at the toes etc.
- stand up and look at your feet. try wiggling each toe independently. try lifting the big toe only, then the other 8
- hand shakes & squeezing  - and then visually seeing the difference from foot to foot afterwards
questions to ask:
- is the foot shaped like your shoe or natural shape like a baby foot - wider at the forefoot than the heel?

- we love to play tennis but we do that despite dealing with chronic pain, tension patterns and repetitive injuries.

- so much of these tension patterns, injuries begin with our footwear and we're not even really aware of it because the pain we 
have in our knees and backs - we don't associate with our footwear b/c our feet don't necessarily hurt.


Definitions:
- The anatomy of a shoe
-----the sole
-----the upper
-----the toe box 
----- the heel

Unnatural vs. Natural Footwear - A spectrum/Continuum
- definitions
- we don't think you need to play your tennis matches barefoot or even in natural footwear
- but what about all the other hours in your days that you could be experimenting with improving your foot health


[Nick]
-- Sneaker breakdown. Go through a few examples. How do we modify FFTW for tennis? 
Flat yes. 
Flexible, sorta. But again, here we need to address the sweet spot of having some protection for lateral stop and starts. 
Thin, sorta but goldie locks - see above. 
Wide, yes.



The SAID principle and footwear [Nick]

-- SAID principle in action. Understand what the shoe is doing to your feet and work to offset those damages. 
Just like we talk about sitting and what it does to our hips. 
We need to extend hip joint to offset hip flexed. Same with feet and shoes. Most tennis shoes will be narrow and stiff
so we need to offset that with toe spreaders, toe mobility, plantar resets, human toe spreader, and time barefoot.

-- The role of surface on the body. Not too many sports are played on concrete. We need cushion to protect, but how much?! 
This is the million dollar question -- obviously more than standard minimal shoe but do we need all that cushioning we see on Rafa's Nike's or 
other tennis shoes? Goldie locks principle here - we want enough cushion to protect but not too much to turn off signals from foot or eliminate
strong, stable foundation we get from "feeling" more of the ground. This is a tricky one..

Show and Tell [Nick and Ruth show and tell about their own footwear journeys]
