Ruth [10.25.22] - A working list of our most effective, efficient and  powerful practices to add to course (Double diamond style - expansive & then narrow to most
important movements for tennis specific whole body health

- The following are brainstormning additions to Foot & Ankle health practices
- for tennis players, adding additional movement practices beyond feet which they most likely have not been exposed to before
1. brachiation-hanging practices
- hanging from a pullup bar or monkey bars (skin on hands is intial limiting factor)
- passive hanging 
- active hanging
- moving and swinging explorations once the body/hands have adjusted
- going deeper - hanging upside down (?)
2. torso/core
- hollow body holds
- spiraling 
- backbending
3. Big Body Play (Katy Bowman)
- using the entire body 
- think animal flow or movnat 
- start small to condition and prepare joints 
- then build on skills to develop strength in whole body movements

3. shoulders/neck
- somatic stretches for releasing tension in shoulder and neck (I will film these for samples - coming soon)
4. wrists/hands
- somatic stretches for releasing tension in forearms and wrists (I will film these for samples - coming soon)

5. Foot & Ankle and Hips will be mostly covered by Healthkit for initial restoration of foot health and learning 1st principles
- building on the skills from HealthKits
- bigger body movements like "Awkward Pose" from Gosh yoga methodology - builds foot & ankle strength and relaxed concentration
- split squat hops - for knee joint conditioning (start low reps and sets and build from there)
- 

- Beam training a huge emphasis for building physical and mental skills like relaxed concentration (Inner Game of Tennis)
