Intro [Ruth]
Hello 
Welcome
Thank you for listening, taking the time
Nick & I are Foot Nerds. 
We take excellent care of our health: 6 pillars
We take care of our health so we can feel good and play throughout our lives, even as we grow older
Tennis is one sport we love. 
We recognized that alot of other people love tennis too.
So many of us who play, though, are plagued by chronic pain, injuries and tension that keep us from playing freely. 
We think this is unnecessary. 
We're working on a digital protocol for tennis and racquet sports players for all levels.
The bedrock of the Foot Nerd Tennis healthkit will focus on restoring healthy feet and but will dive deeper into other areas of the 
body and specifically address areas and topics specific to tennis players of all levels.
Nick and I are going to discuss today, why we're creating this product, a bit about our own experiences, what, how and when we're planning
to release the digital tool. We'll be open to your feedback, insights and would love to hear about you, our community needs most.
So let's dig in.

Nick Holt (11/10/22 Notes)

I like this format Ruth. Here's a rough draft of outline for our 1st chat - 

LAY OUT THE WHY

High hard why...
Move the needle in the public health crisis that is the western world (sick, diabetic, in pain, under muscled, overfat, etc).
Tennis can be a powerful tool to address this issue. Tennis can be a huge lever that gets people moving, is fun, and can be played well into the later years of life. 
It generally gets people outside and it's with other humans.

More specific whys..

- Tennis players love to play and play is the way. I love this. 
"We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing." -- George Bernard Shaw

------ Play and pain
But so many who do play, do so despite dealing with chronic pain, tension patterns and repetitive injuries.

We don't have to be in chronic pain during and after tennis. So most people seek out remedies that mask the root cause or seek medical
help to solve symptoms. 

So if you understand first principles thinking like: SAIDS and the body is self healing 
self organizing organism designed to feel good when we play and before and after doing that activity.


FNT will give people the ability to play tennis pain-free for as long as they want.
