Here's an example from Foot Nerd Experience lesson creation on how we prepared for our recordings. I was thinking we could utilize teh 
same framework to keep it consistent. We'll use github to take prepare our talks. We'll create the outline and assign ourselves to 
which portions of the call each will talk about. We leave room for spontaneity of course since sometimes the conversation goes
in another important direction. The outline we create will keep us on track. 

Example: In this episode, Nick led the discussion and where my name is, are the topics I unpacked. We could do something similar?
------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we have the honor of teaching this first lesson of the 2022 Foot Nerd Program

Thank you for being here. Thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health and for trusting us with 360 hours of your
time.

Our aim is to share everything we know to prepare you for the journey as best we can. 

We aren’t teaching you information. We’re teaching you a framework how to become your own health scientist and we share our current perspective 
in hopes that it will be challenged and replaced over time. 

We are on Slack at least once a week. Have a question about the lesson? message us. Want to contribute? submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Our Core Values: 

Clarity of values is crucial for an aligned community 

==> Responsibility (to health)
- (Ruth) everyone defines "health" for themselves 

Response-able. Able to respond to challenges. Requires awareness and tools

Working towards taking full responsibility for our human experience. Our health, our feelings, emotions, well being, relationships etc

==> Curiosity (to understand)
- (Ruth) definition "an eagerness to learn about something"

==> (Ruth) Playfulness (not taking ourselves too seriously)
- how do we do that? 
- self awareness
- observe the world around us
- willingness to explore 
- cultivating imagination is necessary
- actively remembering how to feel a sense of wonder & innocence

==> Commitment (to the process of health)
- Being dedicated to a cause. A pledge. A promise to ourselves to follow through on a decision. 

==> (Ruth) Open-mindedness
- define 
- not paying lip service 
- taking an honest inventory


------ Critical thinking:

What is it? (*key component of the scientific method)
- a method for HOW to think (most school programs teach WHAT to think)
- the analysis of facts to form a judgement
- the skill and art of asking relevant, necessary and meaningful questions in the quest for truth
- a skill that must be sustematically cultivated through practice
- requires work (to gather information & analyze it, share it, review it)

Why is it important?
- a core tool for applying science to avoid fooling ourselves
- because if we aren't thinking for ourselves, we're trusting our health with someone else ill equipped for the job (because only we can do it)
- because truth is important

How do we foster it?
- through a culture where we understand what critical thinking is and hold each other accountable to being critical thinkers
- by applying it in our own lives (our health process, community discussions)


------ Proof of work:

Your daily health log (timestamped)
Log definition: an official record of events during a voyage. A record of your health voyage

Examples:
- what I did
- what I learned, key insights
- what challenged me
- a big win
- what I want to do next
