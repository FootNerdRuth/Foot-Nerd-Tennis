I like this format Ruth. Here's a rough draft of outline for our 1st chat - 

LAY OUT THE WHY

High hard why...
Move the needle in the public health crisis that is the western world (sick, diabetic, in pain, under muscled, overfat, etc).
Tennis can be a powerful tool to address this issue. Tennis can be a huge lever that gets people moving, is fun, and can be played well into the later years of life. 
It generally gets people outside and it's with other humans.

More specific whys..

- Tennis players love to play and play is the way. I love this. 
"We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing." -- George Bernard Shaw

------ Play and pain
But so many who do play, do so despite dealing with chronic pain, tension patterns and repetitive injuries.

We don't have to be in chronic pain during and after tennis. So most people seek out remedies that mask the root cause or seek medical
help to solve symptoms. 

So if you understand first principles thinking like: SAIDS and the body is self healing 
self organizing organism designed to feel good when we play and before and after doing that activity.


FNT will give people the ability to play tennis pain-free for as long as they want.
