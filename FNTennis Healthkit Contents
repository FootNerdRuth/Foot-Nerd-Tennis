From Ruth [2.23.23]
Mission 
- To help ourselves and our tennis communities stay pain free as much as possible while increasing the quality and 
longevity of our tennis lives. We help by creating a digital product to teach people how to take care themselve by focusing 
on our feet first, recognizing the feet as the foundation for our overall tennis health. 
- We teach people the benefits of natural footwear and better movement practices through an online digital product that includes 
lessons, movements practices, guidance and a large network/community of other tennis players to support each other as we get better and
better.

Why
- Because we think we can help our tennis communities prevent injuries, get of chronic pain and tension patterns caused by unnatural footwear 
and spending too much time sitting in chairs. We think our tennis communities are not getting the simple education that can
help players decrease pain, injuries and tension patterns. 

- start with screens and experiments by Nick H. & Ruth
- screens are: 
1. fms shoulders
2. 4 point liftoffs
3. hang test 
4. resting squat
5. balance screen

Rationale for these screens: 














In the way of lessons and experiments/movement practices
We'll roughly model our product after the Compass/healthkits

Guidelines for filming videos for highest quality but they do not have to be over the top professional
Standards:
1. Most important is audio quality
2. Next is a clean background and decent clarity.

Following the Compass/Foot & Ankle HealthKit model
- adding detailed tennis specificity that suits our communities

Possible Contents of the FNTennis HealthKit: 

-Welcome 
-How to navigate your Tennis Healthkit
Course Material
Start Here: PDF [Proof of Work sheet]
Lessons: 
- I'm wondering what it would be like if the lessons were actually presented as a short lesson combined with a movement practice or 
exploration. Think/imagine a short lesson that illustrates why we will be doing what were doing, followed by the movement and then some 
type of discussion/reflection question to explore? 

The existing lessons of healthkit could be like the foundational lessons if you will and we can choose the ones most specific
to tennis and be ruthlessly picky about the most important ones to include.
Then instead of the experiments presented the way they are in the current healthkit, we create a series of movement practices from feet to head that we think 
would be the most vauable and create mini movement classes that people could actually follow along to. In this way, we would still be
able to teach the fundamentals of health kit and keep those lessons but this is where the specificity would come in.
People would still work on their fundamentals:
- moving toward natural shoes outside of their tennis play
- feet care thru - toega, lacrosse ball, etc
- 10 minutes of balance training
- 10 minutes of squat training

These being the fundamentals of healthkits and then adding in the creative movements for the entire human tennis playing organism :) 
What do you think?
1-Welcome/Introductions
2-Golden Rules
3-Pain
4-Footwear
5-Balance Training
6-Restoring Hip Function
7-Community? 
- perhaps we replace this community one with something else since tennis peeps have pretty distinct community nutrients already in place or maybe reinforcing the idea here that our tennis community is only as strong as our weakest feet, ankles, knees and hips :) 
And that taking care of ourselves from the ground up is also taking care of the health of our tennis communities. 
- unpack the idea of how taking care of our own health first takes care of our communities

We should discuss where we place the ideas from these videos and where we locate them to make the mosst sense
in the flow of the kit.
Progressions: 
Daily Practice 
Golden Rules

Bonus Lessons: In the healthkit, these are the lessons from the previous version of the kit
Proof of work, Screens, First Principles, Becoming a Scientist, Choosing experiments, Data, The Six Pillars, Hips, Less is More, Acute Injuries, Training, Physical Tools, Self Regulation, Feedback
- we can review these and decided which ones are the most important concepts to communicate

Screens: I like the idea of screens coming before the bulk of the lessons. Your thoughts?
And it may be worth exploring the possibility of different screens or more screens specific to tennis?
Foot
Ankle
Squat
Hip
Balance

Nick Holt - Notes 12/21/22
Going wide with possible content lessons / asssessments 

What are the specific body capacities one needs to play tennis well and pain-free?
-- Need feet and ankles that act as springs and shock absorbers. 
-- Hips that have enough range of motion and strength. What "enough" means will be interesting - we can discuss this.
-- Healthy spine, one that can segment, and has "enough" extention / flexion
-- Thorasic mobility - especially rotation.
-- Shoulders that have enough range of motion and strength. Similar to hips - how to quantify "enough" might be tricky.

Possible Assessments:

Trying not to complicate things, but I thought separating joint assessments and tennis skills might make sense? Not sure. 

Joints:
Foot / ankle - existing healthkit
Hip - existing healthkit
Spine - cat / cow, spinal segmentation, standing rotation?
Core -- bird dog, dead bug, crawling?
Shoulders - FMS shoulder reach test? basic shoulder flexion test --> can you get bicep next to ear without arching low back)?
basic IR / ER, lying on ground?
Elbows / Wrists - basic wrist circles, pronation / sup at elbow? 

Tennis skills:
Ability to accelerate / deccelerate - shuttle run test

*** SIDE NOTE*** Braking system could be interesting topic to dive into..
focus on eccentric stength here to improve braking system
“HOW FAST WOULD YOU DRIVE A SPORTS CAR WITH NO BRAKES?”-ROBERT DOS REMEDIOS

Lateral movement - basic shuffle test
Single leg stabiity / balance test - maybe progress balance test from healthkit. Add in some mini hops?



**** This might be off topic but food for thought ****
I always thought it would be fascinating to have some kind of tennis comnbine - like the NFL combine where prospective players get rated on a set of 
strength, speed, and skill exercises. 
Shuttle run 
Vertical jump
40-yard dash
Some kind of VO2 max test
Some kind of hip rotational power test??
