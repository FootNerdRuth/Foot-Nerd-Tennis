This is a sandbox to explore what we want in the healthkit 
In the way of lessons and experiments/movement practices
We'll roughly model our product after healthkits

Guidelines for filming videos for highest quality but they do not have to be over the top professional
Standards:
1. Most important is audio quality
2. Next is a clean background and decent clarity.

Following the Foot & Ankle HealthKit model
- adding detailed tennis specificity that suits our communities

Possible Contents of the FNTennis HealthKit: 

Welcome 
How to navigate your Tennis Healthkit
Course Material
Start Here: PDF [Proof of Work sheet]

or a combination of both?) 
1-Welcome/Introductions
2-Golden Rules
3-Pain
4-Footwear
5-Balance Training
6-Restoring Hip Function
7-Community? Maybe we replace this with something else since tennis peeps have pretty distinct community nutrients already in place or maybe reinforcing the idea here that our tennis community is only as strong as our weakest feet, ankles, knees and hips :) 
And that taking care of ourselves from the ground up is also taking care of the health of our tennis communities.
